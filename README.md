Project Overview: Twitter Sentiment Classification
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most active and impactful areas of research in data science today. Among its many applications, sentiment analysis stands out as a powerful tool used across industries — from measuring public opinion to shaping targeted marketing strategies. As such, it has become a core skill for aspiring data scientists.

In this project, we tackle a real-world text classification problem using Twitter data. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically detect whether a tweet contains racist or sexist content. Given the vast volume of social media data generated daily, manual moderation is impractical. NLP offers a scalable, efficient solution.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from (https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-twitter-sentiment-analysis/)
. It contains labeled tweets that allow us to train and evaluate our model's ability to classify text based on sentiment and discriminatory content.

By automating this kind of analysis, we not only improve processing speed — handling thousands of tweets in seconds — but also contribute to efforts in moderating harmful content and promoting safer digital environments.
